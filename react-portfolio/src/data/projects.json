It then allows the user to save recipes to their recipe book so that they can be viewed later. A recipe can be viewed from either the Spoonacular API, or from a saved recipe in the MySQL database. Each recipe has step-by-step instructions to complete a recipe, providing only information needed such as equipment, ingredients, and instructions with images to match.",
