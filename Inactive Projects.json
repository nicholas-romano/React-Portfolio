        "description": "The Happenings App is a social media application that uses a live, interactive map API that links to a user's review posts to a location and pins it to the map. When the user clicks on the location pin, they can see the post that was created by either themselves, a friend, or another user. Each review created also displays a star rating for the location pinned to help users decide on places and events to go to. The application also provides the capability of customizing a user's profile, and adding friends to their profile. When friends are added to an account, only posts from the user and their friends can be seen on the main dashboard.",

        "description": "This web application uses the Open Weather Map API and gives the user the ability to find the local forecast of any city, state, or country. When the user enter a location and clicks the search button, they are given the current weather forecast including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index which is color coded based on severity, and a five-day weather forecast for the next five days. The weather is indicated by an icon image depicting the type of precipitation. For instance, a sun is displayed for a sunny forecast, clouds for cloudy, rain clouds for rain, etc. The Moment JS framework was used to loop through the five day forecast.",
